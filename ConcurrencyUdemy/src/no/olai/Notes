-- Concurrency -> Application doing more than one thing at a time.
    (Progress can be made on more than one task)

- Every java application runs as a single process, each process can have multiple threads.
  (Every process has a heap, and every thread has a thread stack)

- A Thread is a unit of execution within a process. Each process can have multiple threads.

- Creating a thread doesn't require as many resources as creating a process. Every thread
  created by a process shares the process's memory and files.

- Each thread has a thread stack, which is the memory that only that thread can access.

- Multithreading good for tasks that takes a long time to complete.
    (Ex. DB query, fetching data from the internet)

- Instead of a single thread -> create another thread and execute the long-running task on that thread.
